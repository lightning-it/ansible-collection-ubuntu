v1.11.0
=======

Minor Changes
-------------

- host_firewall - add a fail-closed Ubuntu 24.04 nftables policy with per-function IPv4 management sources, canonical JSON readback, isolated table/include ownership, a single locked rollback-protected transaction routine, and canonical rejection of every IPv6 input spelling for this target baseline.
- host_firewall - add a fail-closed public service access contract with per-service protocol, port, mode, and exact-host source authorization.

Security Fixes
--------------

- host_firewall - prohibit whole-ruleset backup/replay and root nftables configuration replacement, execute nft validation during global check mode, reject ambiguous aggregate source lists, require short-lived signed one-time authorization, enforce a target-specific deny-by-default egress contract, and reject confirmation unless the end-to-end IPv4-only and evidenced provider IPv6-filter boundaries hold. Bound external commands and lock waits below the rollback watchdog, retry stale-lock rollback, and durably order terminal and active-state transitions.

v1.10.0
=======

Minor Changes
-------------

- Add users_accounts_global as a final user-definition layer whose values take precedence over base and extra definitions for the same account.
- Allow the developer_tools role to upgrade operating-system Node.js packages by setting developer_tools_nodejs_package_state to latest.
- Delegate the live LUKS and Tang scenario plus every ``protected-incus`` scenario to the pinned ``modulix-validation`` workflow with an immutable candidate, mandatory post-assertion markers, centralized cleanup, and normalized evidence.
- Make incus_instance reconciliation idempotent for cloud-init, config, and limit values, reject generated key-only cloud-init without an SSH key, and pass configured profiles correctly when creating an instance.

Bugfixes
--------

- Add an opt-in Podman AppArmor profile repair and targeted reload so Ubuntu hosts can restore the package-compatible unconfined attachment profile before validating the direct Podman executable; also reconcile the system Podman socket to its explicitly configured state.
- Allow opt-in Node.js runtime options for npm and npx operations so hosts without working IPv6 egress can explicitly prefer IPv4 DNS results.
- Allow the Podman role to restore and reload Ubuntu's package-compatible unconfined Buildah AppArmor attachment profile independently.
- Allow the Podman role to restore and reload explicitly declared helper attachment profiles needed by the rootless container toolchain.
- Enable Ubuntu's socket-activated SSH listener in generated Incus cloud-init data while retaining service fallbacks for other guest images.
- Install the configurable openssh-server default in generated Incus cloud-init data so minimal cloud images expose the declared SSH contract.
- Keep generated key-only Incus SSH accounts unlocked while password authentication remains disabled, allowing OpenSSH public-key login.
- Make the shared isolated Python toolchain readable and traversable by declared developer users even when controller umask defaults are restrictive.
- Match generated Incus cloud-init networking to both container and virtual machine Ethernet interface names instead of assuming an incus0 device.
- Reconcile declared Incus preseed networks when the daemon was already initialized with different bridge settings.
- Reconcile missing Incus storage pools from the preseed even when another pool already initialized the daemon.
- Reload the declared Podman AppArmor profile on every real role run so an already-correct file cannot leave stale restrictive kernel policy active.
- Remove the generated guest account's unusable shadow lock after cloud-init creation so OpenSSH accepts its authorized key on images that retain it.

v1.9.0
======

Minor Changes
-------------

- Harden the cis_ubuntu24 integration with separate fail-closed remediation and audit modes, exact native-profile validation, an inventory exception schema, immutable remediation and audit dependency metadata, and idempotent handling of the package AIDE service when the cron scheduler is selected. Preserve a traversable audit log directory when inventory disables the pinned upstream role's defective recursive file-mode remediation, and persist the network sysctls whose pinned audit persistence checks are malformed.
- Reconcile the root Incus SubUID/SubGID allocation before daemon operations.
- collection_tooling - Synchronize the centrally managed Renovate policy and guarded automation workflows.
- developer_tools - Add isolated pinned Python tooling, pinned global npm packages, private workspace directories, and SHA-256-verified standalone release binaries for reproducible development hosts.
- github_runner - Add a backward-compatible, data-driven multi-instance interface with isolated installation and work directories, per-instance registration lifecycle with distinct registration and removal tokens, and independent systemd service management. Organization runner groups and declarative cleanup of externally managed legacy services are supported for controlled migrations.
- incus - Add fail-closed JSON discovery, optional preseed initialization, and declarative project and profile reconciliation for Incus hosts.
- podman - Exercise the role in its basic Molecule scenario with isolated, non-mutating inputs instead of a syntax-only marker stub.
- users - Add opt-in exact supplementary-group and exclusive authorized-key reconciliation for security-sensitive developer accounts.

Breaking Changes / Porting Guide
--------------------------------

- Raise collection minimum ``requires_ansible`` from ``>=2.16.1`` to ``>=2.18``. Consumers running ansible-core below 2.18 must upgrade before using this collection release.

Bugfixes
--------

- Guard external GitHub runner service metadata when the optional unit-file check is skipped.
- Make GitHub runner instance validation compatible with strict Ansible boolean conditionals and redact token-bearing instance data on failures.
- Pass ``--no-profiles`` when an instance explicitly declares an empty profile list.
- developer_tools - Bound npm registry fetch timeouts and retries so global Workbench CLI installation cannot hang indefinitely on transient network failures.
- developer_tools - Install Python virtual-environment support before creating the isolated toolchain on Ubuntu hosts.
- developer_tools - Require an exact Packer archive checksum and prevent the OpenShift client archive from reporting changes on every run.
- incus - Prevent initialization, project, and profile mutations during Ansible check mode.
- incus - Treat the recognized uninitialized-daemon response as empty storage state while failing closed for unrelated discovery errors.
- users - Reject malformed SSH key declarations before authorized-key reconciliation.

v1.8.0
======

Minor Changes
-------------

- luks_unlock - Add an explicitly non-idempotent, one-run recovery option to rebuild initramfs after an existing Clevis binding passes every verifier.

Bugfixes
--------

- luks_unlock - Enforce the declared Tang signing thumbprint during preflight and cached-advertisement enrollment, verify persisted bindings using Clevis's URL-only representation, and bound an exact-keyslot online unlock test without exposing key material.

v1.7.0
======

Minor Changes
-------------

- Add the inventory-driven ``lit.ubuntu.openssh_server`` role with validated multi-port transition support, Ubuntu systemd socket-activation reconciliation, check-mode coverage, directive-injection protection, and secure public-key-only defaults.
- Added guarded Ubuntu LUKS initramfs unlock automation with a secret-free Hetzner installimage Dropbear bootstrap, pinned Clevis Tang bindings, and a minimal Tang socket deployment role.
- developer_tools - Add configurable Node.js/npm/npx installation and markdownlint-cli2 validation support.
- docs - Apply the shared enterprise README structure.
- docs - Consolidate generated governance metadata and license policy on shared-assets-lit.
- netplan - Add validated rendering support for tagged VLAN interfaces.
- release_model - Add managed compatibility matrix documentation and structured release evidence fields.

Bugfixes
--------

- shared_tooling - Dispatch collection publishing from protected main with the managed release environment and Galaxy credential, make lint compatibility detection rely on the execution environment, and ignore generated local collection-install and Python cache artifacts.

v1.6.0
======

Minor Changes
-------------

- developer_tools - Add optional actionlint installation from the upstream release archive with checksum verification.

v1.5.0
======

Minor Changes
-------------

- molecule - Run Docker-driver light scenarios with host networking so they clean up reliably through the rootless Podman API socket.
